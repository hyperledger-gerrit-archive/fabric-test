        Description:

        Functional and TPS performance measurement test.
        - This scenario launches a network, as defined below,
          and runs two tests - for invokes, and for queries -
          on single host using networkLauncher (after removing
          any existing network and artifacts).

        Network Topology: 3 Ord, 4 KB, 3 ZK, 2 Org, 2 Peers/Org, TLS enabled
          LevelDB, 4 Channels, 1 chaincode (sample_cc), 8 threads total

        Part 1:
        - Use PTE in Constant Stress Mode to continuously send INVOKE
          transactions concurrently to 1 peer in both orgs,
          for each of the 4 channels (8 threads total, each
          send 100 transaction proposals)
        - Register a listener to receive an event for each
          Block (not per transaction) per
          Channel (full block events - not filtered blocks)
        - Count TXs and ensure events are received for each one (indicating
          each was written to ledger successfully) and calculate TPS results

        Part 2:
        - QUERY all the invoked transactions
        - Count successes and calculate TPS results

        # Run the test scenario: launch network and run the invokes and query tests.
        # We do these two testcases together in this one test scenario, with
        # one network, because the query test needs to query all those same
        # transactions that were done with the invokes.

        # one per org) from which we will collect stats of the number of
        # TX written to the ledger. The summary line should contain
        #     "Channel: all, tx Num: <number>,"
        # This testcase uses 4 channels, one thread per channel, on one peer
        # of each org (total 8 threads). Since all peers are joined to all
        # channels, then all the TX in all threads will be received and written
        # to the ledgers on all peers. Since each thread sends 100,
        # then the total tx Num for all channels on each peer is 4x200=800.
        # For most typical tests, compute the per-peer invoke tx number as
        # (#orgs * #chaincodes * #channels * #threads per org * 100 TX per thread):
        #     2*1*4*1*100=800

        # "Total QUERY transaction <number>".
        # This is seen on the same line as "Aggregate Test Summary".
        # We use an equal number of threads for queries as were used for
        # the accompanying invokes test, above. In this testcase, the total
        # number of threads is 8, each sending 100 queries. However, note
        # only 2 threads (i.e. one per each org) are used for each channel.
        # Compute the per-channel query tx number (which is the same number
        # for every channel, on every peer) as follows.
        # Note: if your test selects AllPeers instead of AnchorPeer, then
        # multiply by the number of peers per org (since all are used for
        # endorsements, rather than just one, which means more tx threads are used).
        # ( #ChainCodesPerChan * #Orgs * #nProcPerOrg *
