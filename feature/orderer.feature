Scenario: FAB-1335: Resilient Kafka Orderer and Brokers
    Given the KAFKA_DEFAULT_REPLICATION_FACTOR environment variable is 1
    And the CONFIGTX_ORDERER_BATCHSIZE_MAXMESSAGECOUNT environment variable is 10
    And the CONFIGTX_ORDERER_BATCHTIMEOUT environment variable is 10 minutes
    And I have a bootstrapped fabric network of type kafka
    When 10 unique messages are broadcasted
    Then I get 10 successful broadcast responses
    When the topic partition leader is stopped
    And 10 unique messages are broadcasted
    Then I get 10 successful broadcast responses
