Feature: Testing Fabric CouchDB indexing

  @daily
  Scenario Outline: <jira_num>: Test CouchDB indexing using marbles chaincode using <language> with 1 channels and 1 index with 1 selector
    Given I have a bootstrapped fabric network of type kafka using state-database couchdb with tls
    When a user defines a couchDB index named index_behave_test with design document name "indexdoc_behave_test" containing the fields "size" to the chaincode at path "<index_path>"

    # set up 1 channels, 1 cc
    When an admin sets up a channel named "mychannel1"
    And an admin deploys chaincode at path "<cc_path>" with args [""] with name "mycc1" with language "<language>" on channel "mychannel1"

    # Invoke in the channel
    When a user invokes on the channel "mychannel1" using chaincode named "mycc1" with args ["initMarble","marble100","red","5","cassey"] on "peer0.org1.example.com"

    # Do explicit query: rich query with the index explicitly specified
    When a user queries on the channel "mychannel1" using chaincode named "mycc1" with args ["queryMarbles","{\\"selector\\":{\\"size\\":5}, \\"use_index\\":[\\"_design/indexdoc_behave_test\\", \\"index_behave_test\\"]}"] on "peer0.org1.example.com"
