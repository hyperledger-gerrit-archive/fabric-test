Feature: FAB-5384 Chaincode Testing: As a user I want to be able verify that I can execute different chaincodes


@daily
Scenario Outline: FAB-5796: Test chaincode - fabric/examples/chaincode_example02 deploy, invoke, and query
  Given I have a bootstrapped fabric network of type <type>
  And I wait "<waitTime>" seconds
  When a user deploys chaincode at path "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/chaincode_example02" with args ["init","a","1000","b","2000"] with name "mycc"
  And I wait "5" seconds
  Then the chaincode is deployed
  When a user queries on the chaincode named "mycc" with args ["query","a"]
  Then a user receives a success response of 1000
  When a user invokes on the chaincode named "mycc" with args ["invoke","a","b","10"]
  And a user queries on the chaincode named "mycc" with args ["query","a"]

  Then a user receives a success response of 990
  Examples:
    | type  | waitTime |
    | solo  |    5     |
    | kafka |    60    |
