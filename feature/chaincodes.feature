Feature: FAB-5384 Chaincode Testing: As a user I want to be able verify that I can execute different chaincodes


@daily
Scenario Outline: FAB-5797: Test chaincode fabric/examples/chaincode_example02 deploy, invoke, and query with chaincode install name in all lowercase/uppercase/mixedcase chars, for <type> orderer
    Given I have a bootstrapped fabric network of type <type>
    When a user sets up a channel
    And a user deploys chaincode at path "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/chaincode_example02" with args ["init","a","1000","b","2000"] with name "<ccName>"
    When a user queries on the chaincode named "<ccName>" with args ["query","a"]
    Then a user receives a success response of 1000
    When a user invokes on the chaincode named "<ccName>" with args ["invoke","a","b","10"]
    And I wait "3" seconds
    When a user queries on the chaincode named "<ccName>" with args ["query","a"]
    Then a user receives a success response of 990
Examples:
    | type  |   ccName   |
